# linear_algebra
Program, that allows to solve SLAE that are present as matrices. For now, it contains two methods: simple iteration and Gaussian. 
But the structure of the code allows adding new methods easy: by adding solver and file processors classes into `app/main_window/linear_system_methods/linear_system_methods.cpp`
